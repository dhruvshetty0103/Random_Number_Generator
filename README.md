# Random_Number_Generator

In random number generator app you can generate a number ranging between 1 to 100 depending on the value set on seek bar which determines the range for random function but the maximum range can go up to 100. It is totally implemented on kotlin by using the concepts of type casting, the value generated by the random function is converted from int to string type so that it can displayed on text field.Number is displayed as many times the generate button is clicked.
We can change the range by sliding seek bar.

I hope it will be helpful enjoy...
